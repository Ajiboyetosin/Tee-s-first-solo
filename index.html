      <td><h3>Hello</h3><br>I'm Tosin and I'm a foodie.<br> I believe as we grow older, it is important we have the little things <br> that would always give us joy no matter what life throws at us.<br> I believe food is one common thing that can give the little joys of life no <br>matter how old we get. You remember how as a kid, a reward of something <br>edible always brought a bright smile to our faces, whether it was chocolate, ice cream, or chicken it always did the trick.<br> We immediately turned from whatever foul or naughty mood we <br> were to an happier one at the promise of food we liked.<br> I believe it would be rather sad to give a excuse of adulthood to lose the joy in food.<br> No matter what life throws at you, always eat first, cos I mean you need the energy to fight and face whatever it is.<br> Never be too old to light up at the sound of food, <br>never be too matured to salivate at the smell of good food.</td>

    <p>Good food is the foundation of genuine happiness. Part of the secret of success is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside.</p>
